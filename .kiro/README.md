The proposed solution is a Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring and Incident Response System using AI, Geofencing, and Blockchain based Digital ID. It tracks tourist locations in real time and warns users when they enter high risk zones. AI analyzes historical crime data, crowd patterns, and abnormal movements to predict incidents early. SOS alerts can be triggered automatically, by voice command, or by pressing the volume button three times, even with limited connectivity. A blockchain digital ID provides secure, tamper proof identity verification. The system shares location and identity tokens with authorities, enabling faster response, improved coordination, and safer travel experiences.
